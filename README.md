# Direct and Residual Subspace Decomposition for Spatial Room Impulse Responses

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the direct and residual subspace decomposition for spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs). The method decomposes SRIRs into a direct part, comprising direct sound and salient reflections, and a residual.
